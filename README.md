# Clustering
Comparative analysis of different clustering techniques.
Here I've showed a different clustering technique on different dataset with their visual representation and how they behave after clustering.
To evaluate goodness of these cluysters i have used three metric scores.

1. Silhouette Score
2. Adjusted Rand(ARI) score
3. Normalized Mutual Information(NMI) Score
